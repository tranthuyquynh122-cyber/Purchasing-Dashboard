## 🧠 Design Thinking Process  

### 1️⃣ Empathize  

**Primary stakeholder:** Procurement Manager  

**Pain points:**

- Difficult to track total purchasing cost across time  
- Limited visibility into vendor performance  
- Hard to identify delayed or rejected orders  
- Reports scattered across multiple sources  
- No centralized view for monitoring procurement health  

---

### 2️⃣ Define  

**Problem Statement**

> Procurement teams need a centralized dashboard to monitor **Total Cost** and **Total Orders** in order to control spending, identify inefficiencies, and improve supplier performance.

---

### 🎯 Key Metrics  

**Primary Metrics**

- **Total Cost**  
  Total financial amount spent on procurement, including product cost, tax, and freight.

- **Total Orders**  
  Total number of purchase orders created within a given period.  
  This metric reflects purchasing activity volume and workload.

**Supporting Metrics**

- Average Unit Price  
- Average Lead Time  
- Rejected Orders  
- On-time Delivery Rate  

---

### 3️⃣ Ideate  

The solution is structured into four analytical layers:

1. **Overview** – High-level KPIs and overall trends  
2. **Vendors** – Vendor performance and cost contribution  
3. **Orders** – Order status, rejection, and delivery analysis  
4. **Transactions** – Detailed drill-down for investigation and auditing  

Each layer answers progressively deeper questions:

> *What is happening → Why is it happening → Where should action be taken*

---

### 4️⃣ Prototype  

A Power BI dashboard was developed to:

- Present procurement KPIs in a clear and intuitive way  
- Enable filtering by time, vendor, category, and order status  
- Highlight inefficiencies and operational risks  
- Support data-driven decisio

- A small group of vendors contributes a disproportionately large share of **Total Cost**.
- Some vendors with high spending also show **higher rejection rates**.
- **Average lead time varies significantly** across vendors.
- Several vendors are not marked as *Preferred* but still account for notable spending.
- Certain subcategories show unusually high average prices.

---

### 💡 Insights

- Procurement spending is concentrated among a limited number of vendors, creating dependency risk.
- High-cost vendors with elevated rejection rates indicate potential quality or compliance issues.
- Lead time variability suggests inconsistent operational performance across suppliers.
- Maintaining inactive or low-value vendors increases data noise and management complexity.
- Lack of alignment between vendor status and actual spending reduces procurement governance effectiveness.

---

### ✅ Recommendations

- Build a **vendor performance scorecard** using cost, lead time, and rejection rate.
- Prioritize strategic partnerships with high-performing vendors.
- Review and renegotiate contracts with vendors that have high cost but poor performance.
- Reduce reliance on vendors with long lead times or high rejection ratios.
- Clean and maintain the vendor master list to remove inactive or unused suppliers.
